**Summary:**\n","This project successfully implements a multi-label text classification model using DistilBERT, capable of predicting multiple genres for movie descriptions. By leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers library, the process involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference. The model can classify new movie descriptions into relevant genres, demonstrating the practical application of natural language processing techniques in real-world scenarios.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AcEM9g3DwZUJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"DqnDVCoHwY4B"}}]}
